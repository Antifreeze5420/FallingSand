# FallingSand
ASMR physics simulators are everywhere. Why not make my own? Physics? Not a concern. Admittedly not very realistic, but still the same mindless game that you can expect. This has a variety of different blocks ranging from smoke, water, sand, stone and others. 
You may find best success in using BlueJ to run this.
